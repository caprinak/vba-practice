The examples are organized in the following order:

1. There is a folder per simple function example
2. All the VBA code is in an Excel-Macro Enabled Workbook (xlsm) and 
starts with "libSimpleVBAFunc...xlsm
3. All the simple VBA functions are enclosed in one 
libSimpleFunctionVBAFunc.bas and it is included in the .xlsm file as Module
named "libSimpleFunctionVBAFunc".
4. All the automation code is included in a module named "Main".
5. If there are any buttons and code behind there would be an additional
module in the .xlsm named "Buttons".
6. The Raw_Data.xlsx, Report.xlsb etc. files are simple examples 
of reports or raw data that the simple-vba-functions and the automated
Excel-Macro Enabled Workbook would use to show some particular scenario.
